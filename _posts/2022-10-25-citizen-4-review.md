# Citizen 4 and Snowden

In class recently, we have discussed security issue related to computers, our online presence, and online anonymity. What we discovered is there is almost no such thing as anonymity, we can find almost anything about anyone after only 5 minutes of searching, and that the our data is being tracked by almost every website. We then watched a documentary about Edward Snowden and the fallout of his actions.

## Prelude

Edward Snowden began working with the CIA in 2006. Over the course of the next 4 years, he becomes skeptical "about how my government functions and what its impact is in the world." In 2009, a CIA supervisor had made an internal report about Snowden, noting that he suspected Snowden attempted to break into a secure computer he didn't have access to. Following this, Snowden leaves the CIA and began contracting work for the NSA through Dell. In December of 2012 and January 2013, he gets in touch with Glenn Greenwald, a lawyer for the Guardian, and Laura Poitras, a documentary film maker. In June of 2013 and with the assistance of The Guardian news outlet, multiple documents from the NSA are released that expose the US government of spying on its citizens and other countries citizens. The fallout of these events led Glenn and Poitra to be heavily scrutinized by the UK and US governments, respectively; and Edward Snowden to find political asylum in 
Russia.

## What it revealed

### **The Documents**
When Edward Snowden leaked NSA documents, it revealed that the US and allied nations were spying on large numbers of civilians, both domestic and foreign. The most obvious issue was that the NSA had a program called [PRISM](https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/search?query=prism&query_type=keyword&record_types%5B%5D=Item&record_types%5B%5D=File&record_types%5B%5D=Collection&record_types%5B%5D=Exhibit&record_types%5B%5D=ExhibitPage&record_types%5B%5D=SimplePagesPage&submit_search=Search) that forced telecom providers to record call and internet data, and then put a gag order on the companies. ![https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/items/show/561](/assets/images/Citizen-4-Post/Screenshot%202022-11-13%20172158.png) The US media and public had a very strong negative reaction to this. Along with this, the NSA also tapped the German Prime Minister's phone. This led to a very strained relationship with Germany during the Obama presidency. The most concerning document (in my opinion) was the [XKeyscore](https://grid.glendon.yorku.ca/items/show/52) software used to track an individuals entire internet activity. Overall, the NSA had unprecedented amount of intelligence reach with almost no oversight and no public knowledge nor consent.

### My Opinion

Edward Snowden is an intelligent and righteous person who sacrificed his freedom and ultimately his nationality for the sake of the average US citizen. As to whether he deserved the consequences of his actions, I don't think so. What happened in the end is that he was alienated by the US government and his utility to the US society and country has been smothered. His life had been upended and his freedoms nearly removed (he lives in Russia now, so you can decide how free he is today.) As for the documents that were revealed, it gives a quaint idea of how much we should trust the US government, or any government for that matter. Multiple countries were (and presumably still are) working with the NSA in all of this. It wasn't the US government hacking the world; rather it was the US government paying (in some form) for the cooperation of other governments to be able to spy on anyone in the world. To end this off, the information he revealed should be used as an example of why a citizen should never implicitly trust their government.
