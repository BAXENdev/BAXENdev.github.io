# A Discussion On Ethics

During the second week of the semester, the class had discussions about ethics. Some of the questions we could focus on during these discussions were: what ethics we held, where we got our ethics from, and how have our ethics changed over time. The had a presentation format, where each of us would discuss our own ethics, and then we could ask any questions and a discussion would proceed from their.

As we discussed where our ethics came, it became apparent that the two most common sources for either religion (a form of christianity in every case of my class) or their parents. Many of those that did not fall into these two majorities had undeveloped beliefs such as "I try to do the right thing." We all have our ethics, but not all of us had conciously developed our ethics as much as others. This became clear as everyone explained their ethics.
