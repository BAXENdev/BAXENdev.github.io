# Decentralized Cryptocurrency

In class this week, we had discussed cryptocurrencies. The professor wanted to teach us about cryptocurrency as a form of investment and what it really is. Here is my take-away.

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum is commonly advertised as a "decentralized" currency that allows you hide your money and transactions from the government. But is this really the case? In principle, yes; but practically, not always. Most cryptocurrencies are decentralized, meaning they are not governed by a government but rather by someone else. But most do not hide your money or transactions from the government inherently. Furthermore, the regulations that gives some amount of reliability to a currency in most nations is not inherent to a cryptocurrency due to the decentralization. So cryptocurrencies are not a "solution" to the government tracking and regulating your money, but rather is an alternative to cash. In the US, cryptocurrency exchanges requires your account to be linked to a social security number, and the exchanges are mandated to report transactions on their exchanges. Along with this, most blockchains, the technology that cryptocurrencies are built on and record transactions, are public to everyone including the government. If in the US, you use a common crypto-exchange with your crypto-wallet, the US government will be able to track your transactions. Back in 2019, there was a hack of gas pipeline and the FBI was able to track who had ransomed the gas company by analyzing the bitcoin blockchain. So cryptocurrency is not particularly private. Rather, its a different form of storing your money that has a risk akin to stocks.
