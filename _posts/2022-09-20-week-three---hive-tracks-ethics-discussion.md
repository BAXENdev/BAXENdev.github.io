## Discussing Hive Tracks

[Hive Tracks](https://www.hivetracks.com/) is a business offers an app to beekeepers that allows them to track data related to their hives. It is was created by co-founder James Wilkes, a beekeeper and Appalachian State University professor (and one of my professors) in Boone, NC. This week, he opened the class discussion up to his business and how the ethics of it. The class split into 3 groups and discussed different aspects of the business. 

## The Hive Tracks Discussion
Some of the easiest questions were about data. Who owned the data that was put into the app and how was it used? Hive Tracks does not keep identifying information and only aggregates data for analytical use. But an interesting issue that came up was with payment systems. Hive Tracks has used multiple payment systems throughout the years. Some of them have been discontinued from future use, but is still used with legacy customers that were already using those systems. This is an interesting business issue that requires maintained support for legacy payment systems. 

Another interesting topic that came up was about fake honey. Honey can be faked and diluted. China is notorious for diluting honey, so much so that they know there measures for how much a honey can be diluted without the dilution being detected. And in Boone, there has a been a shop that sold fake sourwood honey and that shop is now shutdown. This fake honey can be produced for sheaper and used to undersell competition.

James Wilkes also talked about some of the activities of his business throughout the years. A noted activity was how his business participated in investigating a phenomenom called Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). CCD is where a hive dies off with no known reasons for the dying. It was named CCD in 2007 after a large number of hives died across the US. Hive Tracks has helped explore why CCD occurs, and James Wilkes has helped start up a non-profit called Bee Informed Partnership. AppState was a college that was initially sub-contracted to develop software for Bee Informed, which started as a government program to investigate CCD.

Overall, the conversations that took place were informative and interesting. There is much more that was not discussed here, but did teach his class things that all his students will go on to use.
