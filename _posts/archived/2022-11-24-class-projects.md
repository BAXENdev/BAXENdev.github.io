# Class Presentations

My Senior Seminar class is doing presentations soon. We just introduced our topics, and it seems most of us are focusing on various aspects of cyber security. The most interesting presentation was about Intel Management Engine that exists in all intel CPUs, except CIA & FBI intel based computers because they don't like being spied on. Mine focused on various examples of modern mass surveillance, such as the NSA's PRISM software or China's IJOP social credit app. Overall, we have about 2 weeks worth of presentations coming up and they look to be really interesting.
